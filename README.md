# Timesheet Analysis.

This Repository will contain functions designed for analysis and plotting of timesheet information. This type of tangible information is incredibly useful to any project manager or team leader that would like to have plotted data of hours worked on particular projects by certain employees. This type of code was developed out of a need for this type of data plotting, but without paying extra premiums on timesheet applications on the web. We wanted to be able to fully customize what we wanted to see, and have oversight on the development.
